# facebook-video-speed-control

Facebook currently has no speed playback controls for their videos to speed or
slow them down, much like how YouTube does it.

Until Facebook itself implements the feature, may this Chrome extension serve as
your interim solution.

## Installation

The Chrome extension is available now from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-video-speed-cont/mkpjcmkameikplglemncielacjijggoe)

## Contributing

I will update this document to detail how interested people can contribute to the
code. But everyone is free to file feature requests and bug reports on this repo's
Issues page.
